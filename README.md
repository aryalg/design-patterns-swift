## SOLID Design Priciples

### Single Responsibility Principle
- A class should only have one reason to change
- Seperation of cocerns - different classes handling different, task/problems

### Open-Closed Principle
- Classes should be open for extension and closed for modification

### Liskov Substition Principle
- You should able to substitute a base type for a subtype

### Interface Segregation Principle
- Don't put too much into an interface; split into separate interface
- `YAGNI` - You Ain't Going to Need It

### Dependency Inversion Principle
- High-level modules should not depend upon low-level ones; use abstraction
